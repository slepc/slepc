# Hands-on exercises

These exercises introduce application development in SLEPc, the Scalable Library for Eigenvalue Problem Computations. A basic knowledge of PETSc is assumed. The first exercise (exercise 0) is just a guided tour on how to get started compiling and running programs. Exercises 1, 2, 3, and 4 are intended to cover most of the basic SLEPc functionality. The rest of the exercises illustrate more advanced features. All the example programs used in the exercises are included in the SLEPc distribution.
