# Mailing Lists

## Users Mailing List

We do not maintain a mailing list specific for SLEPc users to share experiences and ask questions, but SLEPc-related queries can be posted in the {{'[petsc-users mailing list](https://petsc.org/{}/community/mailing/)'.format(branch)}}.

## Announcement Mailing List

We will update users regarding new releases, changes, etc. through the **slepc-announce** mailing list. This is a low traffic mailing list, with messages sent only from time to time.
