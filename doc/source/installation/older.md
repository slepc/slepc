:::{note}
These are very old releases of SLEPc. They are here for historical reasons. Recent versions can be found at the [download page](./download).

:::{important}
These old versions were released with a different license. By downloading the software, you are implicitly agreeing on the following conditions:
:::

> The software is free for academic and research use. This means that if you work in an academic or research institution such as a University or a government laboratory then you can use the software without formally requiring a license.
>
> For commercial use, you need to sign a software license agreement. This includes all users working for a private company, even if the software is going to be used only for in-house research activities. A reasonable testing period is allowed before asking for the license. Normally, we license the software without a fee, but this has to be concerted individually.
>
> In both cases, please note the following. This software is provided 'as is', with absolutely no warranty, expressed or implied. Any use is at your own risk. In no event will the authors be liable for any direct or indirect damages arising in any way out of the use of this software.
