The manual pages are organized in four categories; we recommend
beginning with basic functionality and then gradually exploring more
sophisticated library features.

- *Beginner* - Basic usage
- *Intermediate* - Setting options for algorithms and data structures
- *Advanced* - Setting more advanced options and customization
- *Developer* - Interfaces intended primarily for library developers
