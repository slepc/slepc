# Mathematical Function - FN

The FN package provides the functionality to represent a simple mathematical function such as an exponential, a polynomial or a rational function. This is used as a building block for defining the function associated to the nonlinear eigenproblem, as well as for specifying which function to use when computing the action of a matrix function on a vector.
