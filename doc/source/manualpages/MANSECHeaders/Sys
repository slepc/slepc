# SLEPc System Functions

SLEPc provides a variety of "system" level operations. These functions are generally used by other SLEPc routines and are not intended for application programmers (except the basic `SlepcInitialize()` / `SlepcFinalize()`).

Other useful tools for application programmers can be found in the {{'[PETSc C/Fortran API](https://petsc.org/{}/manualpages/)'.format(branch)}}, including parallel file access, synchronized printing to the screen, and many other programming aids.
