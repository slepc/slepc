# Polynomial Eigenvalue Problem Solver - PEP

The Polynomial Eigenvalue Problem (PEP) solver is the object provided by SLEPc for specifying a polynomial eigenvalue problem. Apart from the specific solvers for this type of problems, there is an `EPS`-based solver, i.e., it uses a solver from `EPS` to solve a generalized eigenproblem obtained after linearization.

As in the other solver objects, users can set various options at runtime via the options database (e.g., `-pep_nev 4 -pep_type linear`). Options can also be set directly in application codes by calling the corresponding routines (e.g., `PEPSetDimensions()` or `PEPSetType()`).
