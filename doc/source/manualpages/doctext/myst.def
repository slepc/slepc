# There are some HTML tags below. These should work with Markdown, but it would
# be cleaner to use MyST-native syntax where possible.

# Note that the definition lists require the MyST "deflist" extension to be active

# and uses H2 anyways. So we end up with huge headings that take up too much space on the page.
# Changing the first # at the top of the page to ## also doesn't help, it ALWAYS starts with H1.
# Question posted on stackoverflow but likely impossible since # is used to structure the
# document, not just as size indicator
