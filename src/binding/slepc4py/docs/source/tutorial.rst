Commented source of demo examples
---------------------------------

+ To get started, we recommend having a look at the source code of example
  ``demo/ex1.py``, that has comments inserted inline. It is also `available
  online here <../slepc4py/demo/ex1.html>`__. This example solves a standard
  symmetric eigenvalue problem.

* Demo examples for other problems, including linear and nonlinear
  eigenvalue problems and singular value problems, are available in
  the section :ref:`demos`.
