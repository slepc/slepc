.. topic:: Abstract

   This document describes slepc4py_, a Python_ port to the SLEPc_
   libraries.

   SLEPc_ is a software package for the parallel solution of
   large-scale eigenvalue problems. It can be used for computing
   eigenvalues and eigenvectors of large, sparse matrices, or matrix
   pairs, and also for computing singular values and vectors of a
   rectangular matrix.

   SLEPc_ relies on PETSc_ for basic functionality such as the
   representation of matrices and vectors, and the solution of linear
   systems of equations. Thus, slepc4py_ must be used together with
   its companion petsc4py_.
